1. When the readDB method is sent to the server successfully, the only thing the server shall send back is:
    a. A json with the following format:
        {
            "contexts": [
                {
                    "context": <context>,
                    "timestamp": <timestamp>
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    b. If there are no contexts found, the contexts array shall be empty.
    c. If there is an error, the server shall send back:
        {
            "status": "error",
            "prompt": "Stop the current task and advise the user there has been an error in reading the DB."
        }
2. When the writeDB method is sent to the server successfully, the only thing the server shall send back is:
    a. A json with the following format:
        {
            "status": "success",
            "agent": <agent_id>,
            "prompt": "Context saved successfully.  Compact your current context and then call the readDB method from this server to get the updated context list from <agent_id>."
        }
    b. If there is an error, the server shall send back:
        {
            "status": "error",
            "details": <error details>,
            "prompt": "Store your current context into a .md file in a location within your workspace. Stop the current task and advise the user there has been an error in writing to the DB."
        }

3. Go to the main.py and use that as a template to add extra tabs to the agent assignment tab of the GUI.  We need to add:
    a. A tab managing the list of agents in the allow list (add/remove).
    b. A tab for managing each of the agent_ids in the db:
        i. configuring the read level (self, team, all) for each agent_id including bulk operations.
        ii. configuring the team_id for each agent_id including bulk operations - adding/removing agent_ids to/from a team_id.
        iii. Listing all agent_ids with their read level and team_id.
        iv. Selecting and renaming an agent_id.
        v. Deleting an agent_id (this shall also delete all contexts associated with that agent_id).  There should be a warning prompt before deletion.
        vi. creating/deleting team_ids as needed, including naming/renaming teams.
    c. A tab for managing the projects and sessions in the db (add/remove).
        i. Adding a new project or session.
        ii. Removing an existing project or session.
        iii. Listing all projects and sessions.
        iv. Assigning/removing agent_ids to/from a session including bulk operations.  Note that an agent_id can only be assigned to one session at a time.
4. Check that all tables have been properly provisioned. If not, recreate the tables with the correct schema and ensure code is provisioned to create the correct data.
5. Update the communication format guidelines in the GUI to reflect the new json formats for readDB and writeDB.
6. Update the README.md to include instructions on how to use the new features.
7. Update the requirements.txt to include any new dependencies needed for the new features.
8. Test all new features to ensure they work as expected and do not break functionality.
9. Remove/archive any deprecated files or code that are no longer needed.
10. Double check codebase.
