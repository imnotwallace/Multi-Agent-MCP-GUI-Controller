DO NOT CREATE A NEW FILE BUT ONLY EDIT THE EXISTING FILES.  IF A NEW FILE IS NEEDED, PLEASE ASK ME FIRST BEFORE CREATING ONITE.
1. Review whole codebase again.  Reimplement the Data Format Instructions screen from comprehensive_enhanced_gui.py into the redesigned_comprehensive_gui.py file.
2. Reimplement the Project & Sessions screen from comprehensive_enhanced_gui.py into the redesigned_comprehensive_gui.py file.  
3. Improve the Project & Sessions screen to allow creating new projects and sessions directly from the GUI, without needing to edit config files.  This should include:
    a. A "New Project" button that opens a dialog to enter a new project name and description.
    b. A "New Session" button that opens a dialog to enter a new session name and select the associated project from a dropdown.
    c. Project_id and session_id should be auto-generated integers.
    d. Validation to prevent duplicate project or session names.
    e. Automatic updating of the project/session dropdowns in the main GUI after creation.
    f. Projects and sessions are viewed in a tree structure, with sessions nested under their parent projects.
    g. The ability to delete projects or sessions, with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.
    h. The ability to rename projects or sessions, with validation to prevent duplicates.
    i. The ability to filter the displayed sessions based on the selected project.
    j. The ability to sort projects and sessions alphabetically or by creation date.
    k. The ability to search for projects or sessions by name.
    l. There should be a Details & Management window that shows additional info about the selected project or session, including creation date, number of associated contexts, and a description field that can be edited.  This should follow similar design to the comprehensive_enhanced_gui.py file.
    m. The GUI should automatically load existing projects and sessions from the database on startup, and save any changes back to the database.
    n. The GUI should handle database errors gracefully, showing an error message if loading or saving fails.
    o. The GUI should be responsive and user-friendly, with appropriate use of layouts, spacing, and fonts.
    p. There should be an interface that allows assigning agents to projects and sessions, with a dropdown to select the agent and checkboxes to select multiple agents.  Each agent shall only be assigned one session at a time.
    q. Each session should display the number of agents assigned to it.
    r. Each session should only be assigned to 1 project.  1 project can have multiple sessions.
    s. The GUI should validate that an agent is not assigned to multiple sessions at once.  This should not be a db constraint, but a GUI validation.
    r. The project id and session id should be integer primary keys that autoincrement.
    s. The project name and session name should be unique text fields.
    t. The project description should be an optional text field.
    u. The session should have a timestamp field that records when it was created.
    v. The session should have a foreign key reference to the project it belongs to.
    w. The agent should have a foreign key reference to the session it is assigned to.
    x. double check all gui display fields show prohject name and session name instead of ids.
    y. double check all code is updated to use project name and session name instead of ids where applicable, and id is only used for db references.
4. Ensure all new functionality integrates with the redesigned Multi-Agent MCP Context Manager Server:
    a. All changes should be reflected in the SQLite database.
5. Double check and review codebase for any errors.  
6. Test the new functionality thoroughly.
7. Double check for UI user-friendliness and responsiveness.  
8. Update README.md and all other documentation accordingly.
9. Tidy up root folder by moving all old files to an "archive" subfolder.
10. Afterwards, commit all changes and push to the develop git branch.
