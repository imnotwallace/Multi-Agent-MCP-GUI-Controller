- ✅ **WebSocket Cleanup** - Proper connection cleanup after disconnect

#### **Permission System (100% Pass Rate)**
- ✅ **Permission Isolation comp_test_self** - Self-only access working correctly
- ✅ **Permission Isolation comp_test_team1** - Team-level access functioning
- ✅ **Permission Isolation comp_test_team2** - Team-level access functioning
- ✅ **Permission Isolation comp_test_session** - Session-level access functioning

#### **Database Operations (100% Pass Rate)**
- ✅ **Database Connection** - SQLite database accessible and responsive
- ✅ **Table Exists: agents** - Core agents table present
- ✅ **Table Exists: contexts** - Context storage table present
- ✅ **Table Exists: projects** - Project management table present
- ✅ **Table Exists: sessions** - Session management table present
- ✅ **Table Exists: teams** - Team management table present
- ✅ **Table Exists: agent_permission_history** - Audit trail table present
- ✅ **Column Exists: agents.access_level** - Permission level column present
- ✅ **Column Exists: agents.permission_granted_by** - Audit column present
- ✅ **Column Exists: agents.permission_granted_at** - Timestamp column present

### ⚠️ **FAILING TESTS (3/20 - Known Issues)**

#### **Agent Registration**
- ❌ **Agent Registration Success** - Registration process has timing/response issues
- ❌ **Duplicate Name Handling** - Name uniqueness handling needs refinement

#### **Context Operations**
- ❌ **Context Write Operation** - Write functionality requires authentication fixes

## 🔧 Individual Test File Results

### **simple_test.py**
- **Status**: ❌ PARTIAL FAILURE
- **Issue**: Registration response handling needs improvement
- **Details**: Connects successfully, receives tool prompt, but registration response processing fails

### **test_basic_permissions.py**
- **Status**: ⏱️ TIMEOUT
- **Issue**: Test hangs during execution, likely due to WebSocket wait conditions
- **Note**: Previously worked, may be affected by recent server changes

### **comprehensive_test_suite.py**
- **Status**: ✅ MOSTLY PASSING (17/20)
- **Strengths**: Excellent coverage of permission system and database operations
- **Areas for improvement**: Registration workflow and context operations

## 🎯 System Health Assessment

### **Overall System Status: 🟡 FUNCTIONAL WITH MINOR ISSUES**

#### **Strengths**
- **Core Infrastructure**: WebSocket server, database, and permission system all working
- **Security Model**: Three-tier permission system properly isolating agent access
- **Connection Management**: Proper WebSocket connection handling and cleanup
- **Database Schema**: All required tables and columns present and functional
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Concurrent agent connections handled correctly

#### **Areas Requiring Attention**
1. **Registration Workflow**: Response handling and error reporting needs improvement
2. **Authentication Flow**: Write operations need proper authentication handling
3. **Test Stability**: Some tests experience timing issues
4. **Error Messaging**: Better error responses for failed operations

---

## 📈 Recommendations

### **Immediate Fixes (High Priority)**
1. **Fix Registration Response Handling**: Ensure proper JSON response formatting
2. **Improve Authentication Flow**: Streamline agent authentication for write operations
3. **Add Response Timeouts**: Prevent test hangs with proper timeout handling

### **Future Enhancements (Medium Priority)**
1. **Load Testing**: Test system under concurrent multi-agent load
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baseline performance metrics
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing with GUI integration

### **Long-term Improvements (Low Priority)**
1. **Test Automation**: CI/CD integration for automated testing
2. **Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring
3. **Documentation**: API documentation and usage examples
